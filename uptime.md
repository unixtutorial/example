# uptime command examples

## Basic uptime usage

Just type **uptime** in the command line:

```
$ uptime
11:18:23  up 83 days, 18:29,  4 users,  load average: 0.16, 0.03, 0.01
```

## Human readable format for uptime

If you want to be told how many weeks, days and hours your system has been up, instead of just getting the number of days confired, use the **-p** option \(**-p** for pretty\):

```text
$ uptime -p
up 1 week, 4 days, 23 hours, 1 minute
```
